# 2.4 Model management

## Why?
We need a process to keep track of the model. It's not recommendable to use just the file manager.

We need to use this command to disable auto-logging
```python
mlflow.xgboost.autolog(disable=True)
```

Using **mlflow** logging utilities: 
```python
# Log the model as an artifact
mlflow.log_artifact("models/my_best_model.b", artifact_path="my_best_model")

# Log the model as and mlflow model
mlflow.xgboost.log_model(booster, artifact_path="models_mlflow")
```
we can obtain the following information.

```python
# Where the model is stored 
artifact_path: models_mlflow
flavors:
  # We can use our model as a python function
  python_function:
    data: model.xgb
    env: conda.yaml
    loader_module: mlflow.xgboost
    # python version
    python_version: 3.9.12
  # We can also use it as a xgboost object  
  xgboost:
    code: null
    data: model.xgb
    model_class: xgboost.core.Booster
    # xbg library version
    xgb_version: 1.6.1
mlflow_version: 1.26.0
model_uuid: cb835e881b7a410a9f4e1332a5cd4433
run_id: 99a8073207d14d0f86bae40f3489cc44
utc_time_created: '2022-06-04 11:09:59.226073'
```

Apart from the above we also have access to a `python_env.yaml` and `conda.yaml` to recreate the environments that were used to train and test the model.

Clearly this is very powerful and useful to keep track of our model and reproduce it in a controlled environment.

By logging our model as an mlflow model we can load our saved model in two different ways like this:
```python
logged_model = 'runs:/99a8073207d14d0f86bae40f3489cc44/models_mlflow'

# Load model as a PyFuncModel.
loaded_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(logged_model)

#Load model as an xgboost model.
xgboost_model = mlflow.xgboost.load_model(logged_model)
```

This is very important because we can save a model from any framework into the **mlflow** format and then load them easily. **Mlflow** serves as an interface between the ML frameworks. This then facilitates deploying models to different services like Spark, Sagemaker, etc.
